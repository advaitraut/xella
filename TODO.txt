Things to do:
-------------
- The connections need timeouts

- Implement download/upload/push

- Checkout the "routeBack" method, I think it's broken (or too small caches)

- Store statistics about dropped messages

- Prevent connecting to the same server twice

- Store a cache about already seen messages so we can drop them directly
