Things to do:
-------------
- The connections need timeouts

- Implement the server socket again

- Use two permanent buffers instead of allocating all the time

- Implement download/upload/push

- Checkout the "routeBack" method, I think it's broken (or too small caches)

- Store statistics about dropped messages
