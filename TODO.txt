Things to do:
-------------
- Start using the async-i/o
  - learn the async i/o api
  - GnutellaConnection in progress
    - need timeouts

- I think I messed up the byte encodings, dump messages and check it out!

- Implement download/upload/push
- Checkout the "routeBack" method, I think it's broken (or too small caches)

- Store statistics about dropped messages
